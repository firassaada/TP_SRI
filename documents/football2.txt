### Document 2: Rules of the Game

Football is played between two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with two goals. The objective is to score more goals than the opponent by sending the ball into the opponent's goal. The game generally lasts 90 minutes, divided into two halves of 45 minutes. The rules of the game, known as the "Laws of the Game", are regulated by the International Football Association Board (IFAB). Among these rules, fouls, offsides, and penalty conditions are essential to the progress of the match.
